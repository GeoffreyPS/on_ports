## Communication
- `Port.command/3` is synchronous (caller waits)
-  `send/2` is asynchronous
- Messages can be sent to the port by any process with the tuple `{port_owner_pid, {:command, data}}`, even if the process does not own the connection to the port
- Messages will be returned to the port owner
